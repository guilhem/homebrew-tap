# Pivotal Homebrew Taps

This a [brew](https://brew.sh/) [tap](https://docs.brew.sh/Taps) repository containing a collection of "formulae" for software I have done. 

## Usage

First, add this tap to your Brew. This will to clone this tap repository and symlink all its formulae.

```
brew tap guilhem/homebrew-tap
```

Now you will be able to work on those formulae as if there were in canonical Homebrew repository:

```
brew install bump
```
